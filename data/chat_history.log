[2026-01-28 07:54:29] AI: Nikola Tesla (1856-1943) was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, and futurist best known for his contributions to the development of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity system.

**Early Life and Education**

Tesla was born in Smiljan, Croatia, and showed an early interest in science and technology. He studied electrical engineering at the Technical University of Graz in Austria and later worked for the Continental Edison Company in Paris.

**Career Highlights**

1. **AC Current**: Tesla's most significant contribution was the development of the AC system, which he believed could transmit electricity over long distances with greater efficiency than direct current (DC).
2. **Tesla Coil**: In 1891, Tesla invented the Tesla coil, a device that produces high-voltage, low-current electricity and is still used today in applications such as radio transmitters.
3. **Induction Motor**: Tesla developed the AC induction motor, which is widely used in household appliances and industrial machinery.
4. **Wireless Power**: Tesla experimented with wireless power transmission, demonstrating the ability to transmit energy wirelessly over short distances using a system of coils.

**Personal Life and Legacy**

Tesla's personal life was marked by eccentricity and tragedy. He struggled financially and was known for his reclusive nature. Despite these challenges, he remained committed to his work and continued to innovate until his death in 1943.

Today, Tesla is remembered as one of the most influential inventors of the modern era, and his legacy continues to inspire new generations of engineers and scientists.

**Interesting Facts**

* Tesla was a prolific inventor, holding over 300 patents in his name.
* He believed that "the present is theirs; the future, for which I really worked, is mine."
* Tesla's work on wireless power transmission predated modern technologies such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.
