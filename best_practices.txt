Resume Rule #1: Always quantify achievements with specific numbers, percentages, or metrics. Don't say "Managed a team," say "Managed a team of 10 developers, increasing sprint velocity by 20% and reducing bug count by 35%."
Resume Rule #2: Use strong action verbs at the start of each bullet point. Use words like 'Engineered', 'Architected', 'Deployed', 'Optimized', 'Spearheaded', 'Implemented'. Never use passive phrases like 'Responsible for', 'Worked on', 'Helped with', or 'Participated in'.
Resume Rule #3: Keep resume under 2 pages maximum. Entry-level (0-5 years): 1 page. Mid-level (5-10 years): 1-2 pages. Senior (10+ years): 2 pages maximum. Recruiters scan resumes in 6 seconds.
Resume Rule #4: Tailor skills section to match job description keywords. If the job asks for Python, React, or AWS, mention these technologies early and prominently. Use exact terminology from the job posting.
Resume Rule #5: Avoid generic cliches and soft skills without evidence. Never use phrases like "hard worker", "team player", "detail-oriented", "fast learner" without concrete examples. Show, don't tell.
Resume Rule #6: Use the STAR method for achievements - Situation, Task, Action, Result. Example: "Identified performance bottleneck in API (Situation), redesigned caching layer (Action), reducing response time from 2s to 200ms (Result), improving user satisfaction by 40%."
Resume Rule #7: Include specific technologies, tools, and frameworks. Don't say "used databases", say "designed PostgreSQL schemas with 50+ tables, implemented Redis caching, and optimized queries reducing load time by 60%."
Resume Rule #8: Focus on impact and business value, not just tasks. Don't say "wrote code", say "developed automated testing suite that reduced QA time by 15 hours/week, saving $50K annually."
Resume Rule #9: Use consistent formatting throughout. All dates should follow same format (e.g., "Jan 2020 - Dec 2022"). All bullet points should have same structure. Use consistent font sizes and spacing.
Resume Rule #10: Start with most recent experience first (reverse chronological order). Each job entry should include: Company name, job title, location, dates, and 3-5 bullet points of key achievements.
Resume Rule #11: Remove outdated or irrelevant skills. Technologies older than 5 years (unless still relevant) should be removed. Focus on current, in-demand skills for your target role.
Resume Rule #12: Include context for achievements. Don't say "improved performance", say "improved API performance by 300% by implementing Redis caching and database query optimization, handling 10K requests/second."
Resume Rule #13: Avoid personal pronouns. Never use "I", "me", "my", or "we". Start directly with action verbs. Wrong: "I developed a feature." Right: "Developed feature that increased user engagement by 25%."
Resume Rule #14: Quantify team size and scope when relevant. "Led team of 5 engineers", "Managed $2M budget", "Oversaw 3 concurrent projects", "Mentored 8 junior developers."
Resume Rule #15: Include relevant certifications and education. List degree, institution, graduation year. Add relevant certifications (AWS, Google Cloud, Kubernetes, etc.) with dates. GPA only if above 3.5 and recent graduate.
Resume Rule #16: Use industry-standard terminology and acronyms. Use "CI/CD" not "continuous integration", "API" not "application programming interface", "ML" not "machine learning" (after first mention).
Resume Rule #17: Highlight leadership and initiative. Use phrases like "Spearheaded", "Pioneered", "Initiated", "Led", "Championed" for projects you drove independently.
Resume Rule #18: Show progression and growth. Demonstrate promotions, increased responsibilities, or expanding scope. "Promoted from Junior to Senior Engineer in 18 months based on exceptional performance."
Resume Rule #19: Include measurable business outcomes. Revenue impact ("increased revenue by $500K"), cost savings ("reduced infrastructure costs by 30%"), efficiency gains ("automated process saving 20 hours/week").
Resume Rule #20: Keep bullet points concise but complete. Each bullet should be 1-2 lines maximum. Aim for 10-15 words per bullet. Remove filler words like "various", "multiple", "several" - be specific instead.
