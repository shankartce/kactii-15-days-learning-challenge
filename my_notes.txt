• Remember: clarity feels boring only until confusion shows up.

• Idea for a short story:
  A city where streetlights turn off one by one as people forget memories.
  The last light is in a library no one visits anymore.

• Poem draft:
  The morning learns my name
  before I do—
  coffee steam writes it
  on the cold kitchen air.

• Things that feel heavier at night:
  - unanswered emails
  - old photos
  - the future
  - quiet refrigerators

• Quote (original? maybe):
  "Most discipline is just delayed relief."

• Research note:
  Moss doesn’t have roots.
  It survives anyway.
  There’s a metaphor here—don’t force it.

• List of titles that go nowhere:
  - Instructions for Leaving
  - A Practical Guide to Almost
  - Weather Report for Internal Use Only

• Random thought:
  If time is money, insomnia is an overdraft.

• To learn later:
  - how bookbinding works
  - why certain chords feel nostalgic
  - the actual definition of “liminal”

• Fragment:
  We were not brave,
  just early.

• Observation:
  The best conversations happen slightly after midnight
  or slightly before deadlines.

• Writing rule (temporary):
  Don’t explain the symbol.
  Let it be misunderstood.

• Grocery list (out of date):
  - rice
  - lemons
  - something green
  - bread (optional, but comforting)

• Metaphor stash:
  - thoughts like loose change in a dryer
  - plans written in pencil on wet paper
  - confidence as borrowed light

• Reminder:
  Archive old versions.
  You’ll want proof you changed.


• One-line poem:
  I mistook endurance for direction.

• Question worth keeping:
  What would I do if no one ever saw the result?

• Ending note:
  This file is not messy.
  It’s unfinished on purpose.

TOPIC 1: Learning & Understanding Concepts
------------------------------------------
• Understanding ≠ memorization.
  - Memorization = recall without context.
  - Understanding = ability to explain, apply, and transfer knowledge.
• A good test of understanding:
  - Can I explain this without notes?
  - Can I give a real-world example?
  - Can I explain why it fails?

• Feynman Technique:
  1. Write the concept in simple language.
  2. Identify gaps in explanation.
  3. Revisit material to fill gaps.
  4. Simplify further.
• Teaching something exposes weak spots immediately.

• Passive learning traps:
  - Highlighting without processing.
  - Rereading without questioning.
  - Watching lectures at 1.5x with no reflection.

• Active learning methods:
  - Self-testing
  - Teaching others
  - Writing summaries from memory
  - Making mistakes and correcting them


TOPIC 2: Critical Thinking
--------------------------
• Critical thinking = evaluating information, not rejecting it.
• Key questions to ask:
  - What is the claim?
  - What evidence supports it?
  - What assumptions are being made?
  - What would disprove it?

• Correlation ≠ causation
  - Just because two things occur together doesn’t mean one causes the other.
  - Look for alternative explanations.

• Cognitive biases (important):
  - Confirmation bias: seeking information that supports beliefs.
  - Availability bias: overestimating importance of memorable events.
  - Authority bias: trusting a claim because of who said it.

• Class note:
  Being “skeptical” should not mean being dismissive.
  Skepticism requires effort and curiosity.


TOPIC 3: Note-Taking Systems
----------------------------
• Notes are not a transcript.
  - Goal is compression + meaning.
• Good notes answer:
  - What is this?
  - Why does it matter?
  - How is it used?

• Linear notes:
  - Easy to follow
  - Hard to revisit later

• Non-linear notes:
  - Mind maps
  - Concept linking
  - Zettelkasten-style atomic notes

• Best practice:
  - Write messy notes in class
  - Rewrite or summarize within 24 hours
  - Add questions at the end of each section

• Symbols shorthand:
  → leads to
  ≠ not equal
  ? unclear / revisit
  ★ exam-relevant


TOPIC 4: Problem Solving Framework
----------------------------------
• Step 1: Understand the problem
  - Restate it in own words
  - Identify knowns vs unknowns

• Step 2: Plan
  - Look for similar problems
  - Choose an approach (formula, analogy, breakdown)

• Step 3: Execute
  - Follow the plan carefully
  - Keep track of assumptions

• Step 4: Review
  - Does the answer make sense?
  - Can it be checked another way?

• Common mistake:
  Jumping to execution without understanding.


TOPIC 5: Writing & Communication
--------------------------------
• Clear writing reflects clear thinking.
• Structure matters more than vocabulary.

• Basic structure:
  - Claim
  - Reasoning
  - Evidence
  - Conclusion

• Good explanations:
  - Use concrete examples
  - Avoid unnecessary jargon
  - Define terms before using them

• Editing tip:
  Remove words that do not change meaning.

• Class insight:
  If you can’t summarize your point in one sentence,
  you probably don’t know what it is yet.


TOPIC 6: Time Management & Focus
--------------------------------
• Time management is energy management.
• Deep work requires:
  - Distraction-free environment
  - Clear objective
  - Limited duration

• Shallow work:
  - Emails
  - Formatting
  - Admin tasks

• Techniques:
  - Time blocking
  - Pomodoro (25 min focus + 5 min break)
  - Task batching

• Multitasking is task-switching.
  - Each switch has a cognitive cost.

• Note:
  Rest is part of productivity, not the opposite of it.


TOPIC 7: Learning From Mistakes
-------------------------------
• Mistakes are feedback, not failure.
• Important distinction:
  - Error: incorrect action
  - Flaw: incorrect understanding

• Best learning happens when:
  - Feedback is immediate
  - Correction follows quickly

• Reflective questions:
  - What went wrong?
  - Why did it go wrong?
  - What will I do differently next time?

• Avoid:
  - Blaming luck
  - Ignoring patterns


TOPIC 8: Exams & Assessment Strategy
------------------------------------
• Exams test:
  - Understanding under pressure
  - Retrieval ability
  - Time management

• Effective revision:
  - Active recall
  - Spaced repetition
  - Practice problems

• Before exam:
  - Review summaries
  - Clarify weak areas
  - Sleep > cramming

• During exam:
  - Read questions carefully
  - Allocate time per question
  - Start with strongest sections

• After exam:
  - Review mistakes even if grade is good


GENERAL CLASS TAKEAWAYS
-----------------------
• Learning is iterative, not linear.
• Confusion is a signal, not a failure.
• Questions are more valuable than answers.
• Notes are a tool, not a record.
• Mastery comes from revisiting ideas over time.


END NOTE:
---------
These notes are living documents.
They improve as understanding improves.
